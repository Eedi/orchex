# Overview <a id="overview"></a> üìñ

In a snapshot, `orchex` is a library for the orchestration of data workflows, including hierarchical extraction, transformation with pseudonymisation, automated documentation, and secure sharing mechanisms.

For a closer look, you can explore the core module's primary code located at `orchex/dataextract.py`, where you'll find the implementation of the main data classes: `DataSource`and `DataExtract`.

* `DataSource`

    This class contains several methods to facilitiate data extraction from a data source 
    and create a dataframe object. 
    
    Supported data sources: 
    * SQL code
    * SQL file
    * Table Storage database 
    * csv file

* `DataExtract`

    This class allows the user to combine multiple `DataSources` objects at a single entity, enabling seamless execution of the same operation to multiple different `DataSources` such as pseudonymisation. 

    The data from the `DataExtract` will be stored in the following  filestructue: 

    ```
    {name}-{YYYYmmDDHHMM}-{id}
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ {name}-{YYYYmmDDHHMM}-{id}-PRIVATE.pkl
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ {name}-{YYYYmmDDHHMM}-{id}-PUBLIC/
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data
    ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ{data_source_name}.csv
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄimg
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄdocs
    ‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
    ‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ img
    ```

    This class allows for 3 different ways of saving the data:

    * `save()`: _saves a `.pkl` file of the class . Recommended for personal use. __NOT__ sharing data_

    * `export()`: _creates pseudonymised `.csv` files. Best way to share data_
    * `archive()`: _creates a `.zip` file with all the created folders and uploads them to Azure Blob Storage._

üìù
__NOTE__: In both classes there is the functionality to create a markdown report with all the class info.


# 2. Setup <a id="setup"></a> üßë‚Äçüî¨
## 2.1 Prerequisites <a id="prereq"></a> üìã

* ### Python üêç
    `Python version 3.12^` is required

* ### ODBC Driver (if running SQL code) üíª
    If you wish to create `DataSources` and/or `DataExtracts` using SQL code then, ODBC drivers should be installed.
    Please follow the instructions on the following page based on your OS (v17+ is recommended):

    * [Windows](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-au/sql/connect/odbc/download-odbc-driver-for-sql-server?view=sql-server-2017#download-for-windows)
    * [MacOS](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-au/sql/connect/odbc/linux-mac/install-microsoft-odbc-driver-sql-server-macos?view=sql-server-2017)
    * [Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-au/sql/connect/odbc/linux-mac/installing-the-microsoft-odbc-driver-for-sql-server?view=sql-server-2017&tabs=alpine18-install%2Calpine17-install%2Cdebian8-install%2Credhat7-13-install%2Crhel7-offline) 

* ### `.env` file üìÉ
    To extract data from the database some azure specific variables are required to be stored in a `.env` file. If you don't have those information please contact [Simon](mailto:simon.woodhead@eedi.co.uk)

## 2.2 Installation <a id="installation"></a>  ‚è¨

### Poetry 
`orchex` uses `poetry` __(do not use `pip` or `conda`)__.
To create the environment:

* #### Windows <a id="windows"></a>

    ```shell
    poetry env use 3.12
    poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true
    poetry install

    # to activate the env
    poetry shell
    ```


* #### MacOS <a id="mac"></a>


    ```bash
    poetry env use 3.12
    poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true
    
    poetry config --local installer.no-binary pyodbc

    poetry install

    # to activate the env
    poetry shell
    ```

* #### Linux/ Eedi VM <a id="linux"></a>


    ```bash
    export PYTHON_KEYRING_BACKEND=keyring.backends.fail.Keyring

    poetry env use 3.12
    poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true
    
    poetry install

    # to activate the env
    poetry shell
    ```

    ‚ùó __NOTE__:
    if you get the following error 

    ```shell
    This error originates from the build backend, and is likely not a problem with poetry but with multidict (6.0.4) not supporting PEP 517 builds. You can verify this by running 'pip wheel --use-pep517 "multidict (==6.0.4)"'.
    ```
    Run:

    ```shell
    poetry shell
    pip install --upgrade pip
    MULTIDICT_NO_EXTENSIONS=1 pip install multidict
    poetry add inflect
    poetry add pyodbc

    # if package are not reinstalled then run: 
    poetry update
    ```

## Run üèÉ<a id="run"></a>

Example run, where `foo` a function:

```python
from orchex.dataextract import DataExtract

data_extract = DataExtract(
        name="model-agnostic-data-extract",
        description="""A model-agnostic extract of Eedi data.""",
        container_path="data"
)

topic_pathway_collection_ids = (4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11)
answers_ds =data_extract.get_or_set_data_source(
    "answers", 
    foo,
    topic_pathway_collection_ids=topic_pathway_collection_ids
)
print(answers_ds.head())
```

## Using `orchex` in other repositories <a id=otherRepo></a>

Previously we would have installed the package globally using `pip install -e .`, using `poetry` you simply add a dependency to the local package.

1. Clone the repository:
    
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:Eedi/orchex.git
    ```
    
2. In your other repository, add the following to the `pyproject.toml`:

    ```python
    orchex = {path = <path-to-orchex>, develop=true}
    ```
    Example:
    `orchex` was cloned in the parent directory of the current project.

    ```bash
    orchex = {path = "../orchex", develop = true}
    ```

    The develop flag should mean that your installation will be automatically updated when `orchex` is editted.

3. Some environments variables (`.env` and `.sheets`) are required for some components. Contact [Simon](mailto:simon.woodhead@eedi.co.uk) for details.

4. You can now import this package:
    
    ```python
    from orchex.dataextract import DataExtract, DataSource
    ```

5. If you then update this package it should update automatically (if `develop = true`). If this does not happen you should be able to just run `poetry update orchex` but you may need to reinstall your poetry environment. To do so:

    - Close any IDEs (i.e. VS Code) that might be using the environment. (Otherwise the following will fail.)
    - Run `poetry env list` to get the name of the environment.
    - Remove the environment ```poetry env remove orchex-fYa19ibp-py3.12```
    - Go and delete where the environment folder is (e.g. `E:\packages\poetry\virtualenvs`). This is necessary otherwise the next step will just reinstalled some cached versions.
    - Reinstall ```poetry install```
    - In VS Code you may need to manually select the new environment. `Ctrl-Shift-P`, then click `Enter interpreter path...`.
